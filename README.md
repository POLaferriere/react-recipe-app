#React Recipe App

This is a simple CRUD app created with React and Backbone, and using Parse as a back-end service.  This was done at the end of week 8 after 1 week of learning React.  This was also done using Webpack as a dependency bundler rather than using Bower, as we had done for most of the cohort.  

Some of the code has been refactored to work with Webpack and React, but this app was an experiment in sending props and setting state for React components using Backbone to handle the data and Parse to store the data.  The app can also calculate ingredient amounts based on serving size.
